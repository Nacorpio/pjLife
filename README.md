pjLife

pjLife: An engine that simulates the life on earth. 

pjLife is an engine currently in development, and I decided to put it up for others to see.
It's pretty much a simulation of how the life works, and different actions and happenings in life.

I'll be adding a lot of features that can be played with quite a lot. It's quite nice actually.
